## Installation and Setup  

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thefelixmenan/netfelix.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:  
   ```bash
   cd netfelix
   ```

3. **Install dependencies (if applicable)**:  
   If the project uses Node.js and includes a `package.json` file, install the dependencies with:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run a local server** (important for API calls):
   - With **Live Server** in Visual Studio Code: Right-click on `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server**.  
   - Or, use a local server like `http-server`:
     ```bash
     npm install -g http-server
     http-server
     ```

5. **Access the application in your browser**:  
   Open the URL provided by Live Server or the local server, e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5500/netfelix/index.html`.
   **Note:** Opening the `index.html` file directly (via `file:///`) may prevent API calls from working due to browser security restrictions.
